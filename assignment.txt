Word frequency histogram

Write a standalone program that will display (using ASCII art) a histogram of word frequencies from one or more text files (or from stdin).

Your program should be insensitive to case, so it should consider "FOO" and "foo" as "the same".

You should submit your work in the form of a URL to a publicly accessible git repository, which should include the source and a README file that tells us:

Who you are.

How to build and run your program.

We will award monetary bonuses in the form of Quatloos, the currency of the planet Triskelion, to those who achieve one or more of the following accomplishments:

If we can build your project using the standard cabal build tool.

We find your source code to be structured and commented in such a way that someone other than you can quickly figure out what is going on.

We run the hlint tool over your source code and it reports nothing that raises our eyebrows.

You submit a program that we can measure as performing awesomely on a (respectably large) data set of our choosing. Criteria for awesomeness will include such things as performance and memory footprint.

The winner of the most quatloos gets a special edition JPEG of a pony.
