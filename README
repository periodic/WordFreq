# WordFreq

Author: Drew Haven

A simple word-frequency counter for the CS240H Lab1.

## Building

A simple "cabal configure && cabal build" should do it.  After that you can find the executable in ./dist/build/wordfreq/wordfreq.

## Running

To run the program, simply invoke it with a list of files as arguments.  As long as at least one argument is supplied it will read them all in and count all words, printing a histogram to the console.  The output assumes an 80-column width terminal and it may be quite long if the text has many words.
